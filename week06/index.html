            <h1>Welcome to Nigerian Cultural Heritage</h1>
            <p>Nigerian cultural heritage is rich and diverse, spanning over 250 ethnic groups and more than 500
                languages. Here's a brief overview:
                Pre-History (Before 1500 AD)
                Archaeological evidence shows human habitation in Nigeria dating back to the Stone Age.
                The Nok people (1000 BC - 300 AD) are known for their terracotta sculptures.
                The Hausa and Kanuri kingdoms flourished in the north, while the Benin Empire and Igbo kingdoms thrived
                in the south.
                Pre-Colonial Era (1500 - 1914 AD)
                The Hausa city-states and Kanem-Bornu Empire were major powers in the region.
                The Benin Empire, known for its bronze castings, was a significant kingdom in southern Nigeria.
                The Igbo people had a decentralized system of governance.
                European traders and missionaries arrived in the 15th century, influencing local cultures.
                Colonial Era (1914 - 1960 AD)
                Nigeria was a British colony, with the British exploiting natural resources and imposing their language,
                culture, and administration.
                The amalgamation of northern and southern protectorates in 1914 created the modern Nigerian state.
                Nationalist movements emerged, fighting for independence.
                Independence and Civil War (1960 - 1970 AD)
                Nigeria gained independence on October 1, 1960.
                A civil war broke out in 1967, pitting the government against the secessionist state of Biafra.
                The war ended in 1970, with Nigeria emerging as a unified nation.
                Modern Era (1970s - present)
                Nigeria has continued to evolve, with a growing economy, diverse culture, and significant contributions
                to African and global affairs.
                The country has faced challenges, including corruption, poverty, and security concerns.
